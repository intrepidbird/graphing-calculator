## Introduction

IntrepidGraph is a simple yet powerful tool that enables users to input mathematical equations and instantly see their graphical representations. Whether you are a math enthusiast, a student, or a developer looking to learn and experiment with JavaScript, this project offers something for everyone.

### Key Features

- Mathematical equation graphing
- A user-friendly web interface
- Customizable graph appearance
- Real-time graph updates

## Getting Started

To start using IntrepidGraph, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IntrepidGraph.git

2. Open the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd IntrepidGraph

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to access the calculator.

## Usage
For Newbies
If you're new to web development or just want to use the calculator, here's a simple guide:

Open the calculator by following the "Getting Started" steps.

1. You'll see an input field labeled "Equation." Enter your mathematical equation here. For example, you can type y = x^2 to graph a simple parabola.

2. Press the "Graph" button, and the graph will appear on the canvas.

Experiment with different equations and see how the graph changes in real-time.

## Customization
Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the graph, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.

- The JavaScript code for this project can be found in the calculator.js file. It uses the Chart.js library to create and update the graph.

- The code listens for form submissions using jQuery. When the form is submitted, it retrieves the equation from the input field, calculates the corresponding y-values for a range of x-values, and displays the graph using Chart.js.
